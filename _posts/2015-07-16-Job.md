Already 10 days in Tencent, it's a new begining and new experience for me, cause I haven't worked in such a big company ever.  
Gradually familiar with the working environment, working content, at the same time, a lot of friends.  
with few days worked with colleagues, I konw how a anti-virus software worked, and what should the men behind those software do.  
Colleagues in Tencent is awesome, their ability are undeniable. The first and important things I need to do is modestly learn from them. They all my master.  
For ten days ago, the only thing I have done is analysis the Tory--FeiTu, and help alphadu to write a analysis article. The url of analysis article is:  
[Freebuf](http://www.freebuf.com/articles/system/72319.html)  
[Wooyun](http://drops.wooyun.org/papers/7117)  

Now find a target and do some meanfull things.  
Come on!!!
